Hi, remember this is a MIT license project :) see the root of the project to get more info.

This is a early 3d model of our drone (Earhart), this model is only for educative pursposes, is not for final tooling.
This model is no suitable for 3d printing (or almos not with a 0.1 mm of resolution), print at yout won risk!.

Have fun!
